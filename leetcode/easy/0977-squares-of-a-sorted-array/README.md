# Squares of a Sorted Array

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in  **non-decreasing**  order, return  *an array of  **the squares of each number**  sorted in non-decreasing order*.

 

Original
Python
 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
- nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

 

 **Follow up:**  Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an `O(n)` solution using a different approach?

    def sortedSquares(self, nums):
        return sorted(x*x for x in nums)
        
```
